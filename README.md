# Sleepy
Simple Python script that nudges the user to get off the computer by automatically putting the computer to sleep unless they solve a simple math problem. Intended for use on Windows only.

# How to use:
```
py slee.py
```
However, this is useless if the user has to manually nudge themselves to get off the computer.

# How to use (with Task Schduler):
1. Open task scheduler
2. Click on 'Create Basic Task'
3. Follow wizard and give it the location of slee.py and the time to run (I recommend daily at 11:00pm)
